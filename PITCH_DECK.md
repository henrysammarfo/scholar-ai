## Slide 1: Title
# Scholar.AI: Agentic Intelligence
### Orchestrating Autonomous Workflows for Deep Research

*Submission for Agent Arena Hackathon 2025*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Fragmented Knowledge**
Researchers waste hours jumping between broken links, paywalls, and unverified data.

**Shallow AI Chatbots**
Standard LLMs hallucinate and lack the ability to verify facts or plan complex tasks.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
### Agentic Workflows
We don't just "chat". We **Orchestrate**.

- 🤖 **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern:** A lead agent decomposes tasks into sub-plans.
- 🧠 **IQ.wiki Integration:** Blockchain-verified definitions serve as the "Source of Truth".
- 💰 **402 Payments:** Agents autonomously pay for premium data access.
- 🔄 **Reflection Loops:** Self-correcting output generation ensures accuracy.

---

## Slide 4: Architecture
**Flow:**
1. **User Request** -> Analyzed by Root Agent.
2. **IQ Checks** -> Confirms crypto definitions via IQ.wiki.
3. **Parallel Tools** -> Tavily executes 3 distinct searches (Overview, Details, Trends).
4. **Writer Agent** -> Synthesizes all tool outputs into a report.
5. **Delivery** -> Streamed to the Anti-Gravity UI.

---

## Slide 5: Tech Stack
- **Agent Engine:** IQAI ADK-TS (TypeScript)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TailwindCSS
- **Physics Engine:** Matter.js (Anti-Gravity UI)
- **Web3:** Reown AppKit, Base Sepolia
- **Data:** Tavily, IQ.wiki
